# It SHOULD at least have following headers as those will be directly used by

# Animal information is used in DESeq2 where gene-to-transcript functions are used.
# Provide animal name in which you are performing current analysis

# Genome files
#
# Note about rRNA database:
# rrna_db is folder containing rRNA database files
# I usually use from Silva database https://www.arb-silva.de/
# In this workflow, I have used only Eukaryotic databases by filtering files
# which starts with 'silva-euk'. You can add your rule by changing
# appropriate function in sortmerna.smk file
#
# Another source to take these files is directly from SortMeRNA github
# repository : https://github.com/biocore/sortmerna/tree/master/data/rRNA_databases

# DESeq2 related
# Currently this analysis can automatically performs analysis with design
# formula as provided by 'design' parameter.
#
# 'condition' is the column name in 'samples.csv' where you should define
#  your sample's condition which will be used in DESeq2 analysis.
#  Unfortunately, currently this pipeline do not accept more complicated
#  designs. I will probably add support to more complex designs soon. For
#  now you need to edit 'script/deseq2.R' file if you want more fine control
#  over you complex design
#
#  star, salmon, stringtie, kallisto parameters decides which method
#  generated counts will be used in the analysis. Possible values: true, false

deseq2:
  # Your design formula
  design: "~ condition"
  # Name of column which will be used to calculate conditions
  design_column: "condition"
  # Reference condition

  # Set 'true' if you want to perform analysis based on counts generated by
