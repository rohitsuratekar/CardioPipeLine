# Tasks
# See README for more details. Keep '0' to perform all tasks
# It can be single number -> tasks: 0
# Or can be list of numbers -> tasks: 1, 2, 3 ...
# Or can be range -> tasks: 3-8
# Or can be mix -> tasks: 1, 5, 10-15
tasks: 3-17

# All samples
# It SHOULD at least have following headers as those will be directly used by
# pandas. You can have other fields which will be ignored.
# run, is_paired
# Check README.md file for more information

samples: "config/samples.csv"

# Animal information is used in DESeq2 where gene-to-transcript functions are used.
# Provide animal name in which you are performing current analysis
animal: "Danio rerio"

# Genome files
#
# Note about rRNA database:
# rrna_db is folder containing rRNA database files
# I usually use from Silva database https://www.arb-silva.de/
# In this workflow, I have used only Eukaryotic databases by filtering files
# which starts with 'silva-euk'. You can add your rule by changing
# appropriate function in sortmerna.smk file
#
# Another source to take these files is directly from SortMeRNA github
# repository : https://github.com/biocore/sortmerna/tree/master/data/rRNA_databases

# Extra parameter values needed for Kallisto analysis of Single Layout Reads
extra:
  kallisto-fragment-length: 200
  kallisto-standard-deviation: 20


# DESeq2 related
# Currently this analysis can automatically performs analysis with design
# formula as provided by 'design' parameter.
#
# 'condition' is the column name in 'samples.csv' where you should define
#  your sample's condition which will be used in DESeq2 analysis.
#  Unfortunately, currently this pipeline do not accept more complicated
#  designs. I will probably add support to more complex designs soon. For
#  now you need to edit 'script/deseq2.R' file if you want more fine control
#  over you complex design
#
#  star, salmon, stringtie, kallisto parameters decides which method
#  generated counts will be used in the analysis. Possible values: true, false

deseq2:
  # Your design formula
  design: "~ condition"
  # Name of column which will be used to calculate conditions
  design_column: "condition"
  # Reference condition
  reference: "24"
  # Set 'true' if you want to perform analysis based on counts generated by
  # following tools (otherwise set 'false'). At least one is mandatory
