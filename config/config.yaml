# Note about rRNA database:
# rrna_db is folder containing rRNA database files
# I usually use from Silva database https://www.arb-silva.de/
# In this workflow, I have used only Eukaryotic databases by filtering files
# which starts with 'silva-euk'. You can add your rule by changing
# appropriate function in sortmerna.smk file
#
# Another source to take these files is directly from SortMeRNA github
# repository : https://github.com/biocore/sortmerna/tree/master/data/rRNA_databases
